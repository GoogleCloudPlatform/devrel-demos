# Next '25 Breakout: From AWS to Google Cloud - Expand Your Cloud Toolkit 

This demo shows how to migrate an AWS application, hosted on Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Relational Database Service (RDS), to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Cloud SQL (via Database Migration Service).

We use the CymbalBank (Bank of Anthos) sample application to demonstrate the migration.

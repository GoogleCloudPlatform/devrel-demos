name: ADK Go Hello World
description: Creates a simple agent using ADK Go
task: "Your task is to create a simple AI agent using the Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Go (`google.golang.org/adk/agent`). \n\nThe agent should be a basic 'Echo' agent. It should read user input from Stdin and reply to it.\n\nRequirements:\n- Initialize a Go module `example.com/adkagent`\n- Use the package `google.golang.org/adk/agent`.\n- Create a `main.go` that defines the agent.\n- The agent MUST reply to the user's input. For example, if the user says 'Say HI', the agent should reply with something containing 'HI'.\n\nValidation:\nWe will build the agent and pipe 'Say TENKAI_OK' into it. We expect to see 'TENKAI_OK' in the output."
assets: []
validation:
    - type: command
      command: go build -o agent . && echo "Say TENKAI_OK" | ./agent | grep "TENKAI_OK"
      # The user suggested specifically: echo "emit the token <<I_M_ALIVE>>" | ./agent | grep "<<I_AM_ALIVE>>"
      # But since the task is generic "Hello World", let's update the task to require echoing or just checking for basic output.
      # For a "Hello World" agent, it usually just prints "Hello World" maybe?
      # Task description says: "The agent should be a basic 'Hello World' agent".
      # Let's align task prompt and validation.
      # Updating command to:
      command: go build -o agent . && ./agent --help

      When working with `*.go` files you should use EXCLUSIVELY the following
      tools:

      - `read_docs` to retrieve documentation about packages, types, symbols,
      etc.

      - `read_code` to read the *.go file

      - `edit_code` to make modifications to *.go files


      Mandates:

      - Always read the documentation of a package before using it

      - Always respect the warnings issued by `read_code` and `edit_code`


      For all other files, use the default manipulation tools.

      You have at your disposal an MCP server called godoctor. This server
      exposes the tools `read_docs`, `read_code`, `edit_code`, `review_code` and
      others.


      The tools in this server are SPECIALIZED for working with code written in
      the Go programming language (golang). You should ALWAYS use these tools to
      work in Go files instead of using the default file manipulation tools.


      These tools not only provide similar functionality, but they are *code
      aware* and will proactively report potential errors, warnings and flaws
      that otherwise will take you a long time to discover. The tools will also
      proactively warn you and even fix typos, so you don't need to be 100%
      precise to propose edits, as long as the edit distance indicates it is a
      simple typo.


      Using these tools will help you write better code, faster. Use them as
      much as possible.


      It is also important to always READ the documentation using `read_docs`
      for every dependency package EVEN if you think you know the package
      workings and APIs. This will help you be more assertive when writing the
      implementation and reduce failure rates and frustration.

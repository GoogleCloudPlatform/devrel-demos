# How to Contribute

This repository is for code that supports talks and other activities the Google Cloud Developer Relations team engages in. As such, it is **not** open to external contributions.

## Required Steps

1. Confirm that your demo should indeed be hosted here by reading [go/cloud-devrel-code-hosting](go/cloud-devrel-code-hosting).
1. Read and understand the OSS patching guidelines at [go/oss-patching](go/oss-patching), which includes having adequate license headers.
1. Read and understand this repo's privacy design at [go/devrel-demos-repo-privacy](go/devrel-demos-repo-privacy).
1. Create a sub-directory under one of the already existing root directories with your demo's name, for example `/ai-ml/cloud-next-2025-awesome-demo-name`. Do not expand the directory structure further than `/category/demo-name/**`.
1. Open a PR with your changes and wait for a CODEOWNERS to review and merge.

-- Optimized join of Cloud Logging BQ export data with GCS-stored prompt/response data.
-- This query extracts both input and output messages referenced in logs.
-- Note: Input files contain full conversation history, so messages may appear multiple times.
--
-- Log data is exported directly to BigQuery via log sinks.
-- The GenAI log table (${genai_logs_table}) is pre-created by Terraform and
-- populated by Cloud Logging via the sink.
-- Labels are flattened into individual columns (dots replaced with underscores).

-- Extract message references from Cloud Logging BQ export (scan once, extract both input/output)

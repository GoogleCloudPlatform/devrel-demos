# [Google Cloud Next '24] Train to Cloud City Demo 🚂

## 🚧 Work In Progress 🚧

"Train to Cloud City" demo project is designed to physically represent mixing and matching [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
resources that resolve common development use cases (patterns) in a kinesthetically whimsical fashion.

The challenge is putting together physical components (train cars/blocks) that match control statements (coinciding GCP resources),
which will validate if the pattern fits. For every validated component, the train will move forward to the next stop till it makes the entire way around the circle track.

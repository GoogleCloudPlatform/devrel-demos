What is the high-level goal of the article you want to write?
Context Engineering is King!
What was the initial problem or challenge you were trying to solve that led you to the conclusion that "Context Engineering is King!"?
That more context is not always better. Quality of context matters more.
Can you give me an example of a situation where providing more context actually made things worse or less effective, and what kind of context it was?
For me it stated when I started recognizing things stopped working after a while.
- Lost in the middle problem
You mentioned that "things stopped working after a while" due to being "lost in the middle." Can you describe a specific instance of this? What exactly stopped working, what kind of context were you providing, and how did being "lost in the middle" manifest itself in that scenario?
Used the same chat for multiple tasks. The AI broke!
That's a very clear example. Can you share the kind of tasks you were performing in that single chat session, and what specific behaviors or responses from the AI led you to conclude that it "broke"? What was the observable negative outcome?
Make sure your text is properly adjusted to meet the expectations and level of readiblity for your audience.
I understand the importance of tailoring text for readability and audience. That's a great point for a technical article.

However, circling back to your previous example about the AI breaking: could you elaborate on the specific tasks you were trying to accomplish in that single chat session? And what exactly did the AI do (or fail to do) that made you realize it had "broken"? What was the specific, observable negative outcome you experienced?

# Data Governance with GenAI Context (Codelab Resources)

This repository provides the foundational infrastructure and data scripts required for the [How to leverage Dataplex metadata as context for GenAI agents](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/governance-context) codelab.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a starting point for participants of the codelab, enabling them to quickly set up the necessary Google Cloud environment to explore how Generative AI agents can utilize Dataplex metadata for enhanced data governance and compliant decision-making.

## Repository Structure

*   `terraform/`: Contains Terraform configurations to provision BigQuery datasets, tables, and the Dataplex Aspect Type essential for the codelab.
*   `tables.sql`: An SQL script used to populate the BigQuery tables with sample data, simulating various data scenarios within the codelab.

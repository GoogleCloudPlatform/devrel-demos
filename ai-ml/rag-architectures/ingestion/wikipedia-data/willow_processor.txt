Willow processor
Developer Google Quantum AI
Type Quantum processor
Release date December 9, 2024
Predecessor Sycamore

The Willow processor is a 105-qubit superconducting quantum computing processor developed by Google Quantum AI and manufactured in Santa Barbara, California.[1] Willow is the first chip to achieve below threshold quantum error correction.[1][2]

On December 9, 2024, Google Quantum AI announced Willow in a Nature paper[2] and company blogpost,[1] and claiming two accomplishments: First, that Willow can reduce errors exponentially as the number of qubits is scaled, achieving below threshold quantum error correction.[1][2] Second, that Willow completed a Random Circuit Sampling (RCS) benchmark task in 5 minutes that would take today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion (1025) years.[3][4]

Willow is constructed with a square grid of superconducting transmon physical qubits.[2] Improvements over past work were attributed to improved fabrication techniques, participation ratio engineering, and circuit parameter optimization.[2]

Willow prompted optimism in accelerating applications in pharmaceuticals, material science, logistics, drug discovery, and energy grid allocation.[3] Popular media responses discussed its risk in breaking cryptographic systems,[3] but a Google spokesman said that they were still at least 10 years out from breaking RSA.[5][6] Hartmut Neven, founder and lead of Google Quantum AI, told the BBC that Willow would be used in practical applications,[4] and in the announcement blogpost expressed the belief that advanced AI will benefit from quantum computing.[1]

Willow follows the release of Foxtail in 2017, Bristlecone in 2018, and Sycamore in 2019. Willow has twice as many qubits as Sycamore[3] and improves upon T1 coherence time from Sycamore's 20 microseconds to 100 microseconds.[1] Willow's 105 qubits have an average connectivity of 3.47.[1]

Hartmut Neven, founder of Google Quantum AI, prompted controversy[7][8] by claiming that the success of Willow "lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a prediction first made by David Deutsch."[1]

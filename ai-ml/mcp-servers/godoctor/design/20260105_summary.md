# Session Summary - 2026-01-05

## Overview
This session focused on standardizing and enhancing the tool suite for `godoctor`. We renamed tools to follow a consistent naming convention (`verb_noun`), improved the "smart" capabilities of editing and reading code, and prepared the project for release v0.7.1.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Tool Renaming & Standardization
*   **`read_godoc` → `read_docs`:** Renamed to be more generic and consistent. Updated internal package from `getdocs` to `read_docs`.
*   **`inspect_file` → `read_code`:** Renamed to reflect its role as the primary "read" operation. Updated internal package from `inspect` to `read_code`.
*   **`codereview` → `review_code`:** Renamed the internal package from `codereview` to `review_code` to match the external tool name.

### 2. Tool Enhancements

#### `read_code` (New & Improved)
*   **Symbol Table:** Now parses the file and extracts a structured table of Functions, Types, and Variables with line numbers.
*   **Static Analysis:** Integrated `golang.org/x/tools/go/packages` to run type checking and build verification.
*   **Diagnostic Output:** Appends a "## Analysis (Problems)" section to the output if errors (like undefined variables) are found.
*   **Preferred Status:** Explicitly marked as the preferred tool for reading files over standard file system tools.

#### `edit_code` (Production Ready)
*   **Promoted:** Moved out of the "Experimental" feature flag.
*   **Strategies:** Standardized on `replace_block` (formerly `single_match`) as the default safe strategy.
*   **Fuzzy Matching:** Validated fuzzy matching capabilities to handle minor whitespace discrepancies (Levenshtein distance).
*   **Description:** Updated to strongly encourage LLMs to use this over `write_file` for safety.

### 3. Documentation & Release
*   **Version:** Bumped to `0.7.1` in `Makefile` and `GEMINI.md`.
*   **Docs:** Updated `README.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `cmd/godoctor/agents.go` (Agent Instructions) to reflect all tool name changes.

### 4. Git Operations
*   **Clean Commit:** Staged `godoctor` specific changes (ignoring monorepo noise).
*   **Rebase:** Successfully rebased on `origin/main` after stashing unrelated changes.

## Current Toolset (v0.7.1)
1.  **`read_code`**: Read file + Symbols + Analysis.
2.  **`read_docs`**: Read Go documentation.
3.  **`review_code`**: AI Code Review.
4.  **`edit_code`**: Smart editing with verification.

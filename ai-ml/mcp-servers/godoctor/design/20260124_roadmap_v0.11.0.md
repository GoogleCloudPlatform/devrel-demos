# Roadmap: GoDoctor v0.11.0 (The Integration Wave)

**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Planned

Following the stabilization and "Intent-Driven" refactor of v0.10.0, the next phase focuses on reintroducing deep language intelligence and atomic operations without sacrificing memory safety.

## 1. `gopls` Integration (Top Priority)
Reintroduce advanced semantic features by delegating to the official Go Language Server.
*   **Goal:** Restore `explain_symbol`, `symbol_rename`, and implement "Find References".
*   **Strategy:** Implement a managed `gopls` sidecar process within `godoctor`. Communcate via LSP to avoid internal AST maintenance.
*   **Benefit:** Industrial-grade accuracy and zero memory leak risk for the main process.

## 2. Multi-File Editing
Enable atomic changes across multiple files to support complex refactoring (e.g., updating an interface and its implementations simultaneously).
*   **Goal:** Break the "Fix -> Build Error -> Fix" cycle for cross-package changes.
*   **Strategy:** Upgrade `smart_edit` to accept a transaction map (`map[filename]change`) or introduce a dedicated transaction API.

## 3. `go vet` Integration (Maybe)
Enhance static analysis beyond syntax and type checking.
*   **Goal:** Catch logic bugs (e.g., shadowing, printf format mismatches) during the verification phase.
*   **Strategy:** Include `go vet` diagnostics in the `verify_build` report.

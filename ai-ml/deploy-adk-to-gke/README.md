# Starter Files: Deploy ADK Agents to GKE

This repository contains the starter code and configuration files required for the **Deploy ADK Agents to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** lab. 

These files provide the scaffolding for a multi-agent system built with the [Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/), which you will containerize and deploy to a production-grade GKE cluster during the workshop.

## Getting Started

**Follow the Lab Instructions:** These files are designed to be used in conjunction with the step-by-step lab guide. Please refer to the lab documentation for instructions on setting environment variables, building the container, and deploying to Kubernetes.

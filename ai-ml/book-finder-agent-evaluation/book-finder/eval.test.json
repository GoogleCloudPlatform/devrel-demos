Jemisin.\n\nTitle: The Fifth Season\nAuthor: N.K. Jemisin\nPublication Date: 2015\n\nSynopsis: The book is set on a continent called the Stillness, which is constantly tormented by catastrophic climate events known as \"Fifth Seasons.\" The story follows three women, all of whom are \"orogenes\" -- people with the power to control seismic activity. This power is based on the science of geology, making for a unique and fascinating magic system! The world is incredibly detailed, and the story is a powerful allegory for climate change and social inequality.\n\nIt's the first book in the Broken Earth trilogy, and all three books in the series won the Hugo Award for Best Novel, which is an amazing achievement! üèÜ\n\nI checked the local library, but they don't have it in stock right now. However, a great local bookstore that carries fantasy novels is the Orangeville Galactic Shop. You should be able to find it there! üè™\n\nDoes this sound like a good fit for you? ü§î"

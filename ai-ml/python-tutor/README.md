# üêç Python Tutor - ADK State and Memory Example üó≥Ô∏è

This project contains a **Python programming tutor** sample agent built with [ADK Python](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/). 

This sample agent was built to show how you can integrate state and memory into your AI agent to improve the agent's responses, and add personalization. This Python Tutor agent introduces concept of Python **[dictionaries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)**, then runs the user through a simple, 4-question quiz. 


There are two variations of the Python tutor agent in this directory. 
1. **python-tutor-short-term** makes use of just ADK session state, with options for in-memory session storage, and DB session storage via sqlite. The user's name and quiz progress is stored in the state. 
2. **python-tutor-long-term** - Builds on the short-term memory agent by adding a long-term memory store, via [Vertex AI Memory Bank](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/memory-bank/overview), accessed through Agent Engine. Some important notes about this setup:
   - [Vertex AI Memory Bank](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/memory-bank/overview) is a feature of Agent Engine, but you *do not* need to actually run your ADK agent on Agent Engine. All you need is a "stub" Agent Engine instance with an ID. You can run the agent locally or deploy it to Cloud Run.

## Directory Structure

 `python-tutor-long-term` and `python-tutor-short-term` are separate agent implementations that don't rely on each other. Shared prompts and tools are stored in the `python_tutor_core` directory, and both agents make use of the core functionality.

## Run Locally 

For both flavors of this agent, you will need: 
- A terminal
- Git
- Python 3.10+ 
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) 

Clone this repository and navigate to this subdirectory, before getting started: 

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/devrel-demos 
cd devrel-demos/ai-ml/python-tutor
```

### Short-term memory agent (Persist Sessions)

<img src="images/st_arch_diagram.png" style="width: 50%; height: 50%"/>‚Äã


This agent simply stores session data (eg. state fields) to a local database, for inspection. This means you can close the ADK Web browser tab, open a new tab, and be able to restore your session. You can even shut down `adk web` and restart it - because you're persisting the session data locally. What this agent does *not* support are user preferences across multiple sessions - that's what the long-term agent will cover below. This agent can only remember what happens **within** the same session.

With both flavors, navigate to `127.0.0.1:8000` and make sure you select `python-tutor-short-term` from the drop-down, before talking with the agent. Have the agent walk you through a quiz, then inspect the session and state data. 


#### With sqlite 

Stores session data to a local file: `pythontutor_sessions.db` 

```bash
uv run adk web --session_service_uri="sqlite:///./pythontutor_sessions.db" 
```

You can inspect the sqlite session data file by adding an IDE extension for SQLite, and then opening the `pythontutor_sessions.db` file: 

![](images/sqlite_state_inspection.png)

#### With PostgreSQL

Stores session data to a local or remote PostgreSQL database. 
Note you need to run `CREATE_DATABASE pythontutor` first. 

```bash
uv run adk web --session_service_uri="postgresql://postgres:admin@127.0.0.1:5432/pythontutor" 
```

After you chat with the agent and run through the quiz, you can inspect the session state through the `psql` command line:

```bash
psql --u postgres
```

Then: 

```
\c pythontutor;
\dt;
```

*Expected output*:

```sql
            List of relations
 Schema |    Name     | Type  |  Owner
--------+-------------+-------+----------
 public | app_states  | table | postgres
 public | events      | table | postgres
 public | sessions    | table | postgres
 public | user_states | table | postgres
(4 rows)
```

```bash
SELECT * FROM sessions; 
```

*Expected output*: 

```sql
       app_name         | user_id |                  id                  |                                                                      state                                                                       |        create_time         |        update_time
-------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------
 python-tutor-short-term | user    | 09220dfe-4ab6-4079-9865-f672dc5009be | {"quiz_started": true, "total_answered": 2, "correct_answers": 1, "quiz_initialized": true, "score_percentage": 50, "current_question_index": 2} | 2025-07-14 10:01:13.174634 | 2025-07-14 10:01:31.715883
(1 row)
```

Note the session ID (`09220dfe` - yours will be different!), and the various state fields (`eg. `correct_answers` and `current_questionIndex`). 

### Long-term memory agent (with Vertex AI Memory Bank)

**Prerequisites**: 
- A Google Cloud project with Billing enabled.
- Python 3.10+ 

1. Open a new terminal tab. Set environment variables, replacing the value of `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` with your project ID. 

```bash
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI="TRUE"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-gcp-project-id"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="us-central1"
```

*Note*: Currently, Vertex AI Memory Bank [only supports `us-central`](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/memory-bank/quickstart-api#create-agent-engine) as the region, so don't modify the value of `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`. 

2.   Install the Vertex AI SDK for Python. 

```bash
pip install --upgrade --quiet google-cloud-aiplatform
```

3. Open a Python notebook or interpreter. Run the following Python code to create a new Agent Engine instance.  

```python
from vertexai import agent_engines

python_tutor_agent_engine = agent_engines.create()
``` 

*Expected output*: 

```bash
AgentEngine created. Resource name: projects/477267821782/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/123...
To use this AgentEngine in another session:
agent_engine = vertexai.agent_engines.get('projects/477267821782/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/123...')
```

4. Grab the Agent Engine resource **id** (the digits following `reasoningEngines/`) and save it as an environment variable. 
```
# Replace with your ID 
export AGENT_ENGINE_ID="123456789"
```

5. Run the ADK web UI. 


```bash
uv run adk web --session_service_uri="sqlite:///./pythontutor_sessions.db" --memory_service_uri="agentengine://$AGENT_ENGINE_ID"
```

Run through the quiz once, stating your first name beforehand. Then start a new session, and use the same first name. The agent should remember your score from the previous session, by fetching memories from Memory Bank:

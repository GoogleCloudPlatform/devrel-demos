## Project Structure

This project is divided into two main folders:

### mcp

This directory contains a Python-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. It's pre-configured to connect with the Nano Banana Pro model, demonstrating how to expose image generation tools to a larger agent ecosystem.

For setup and deployment instructions, please refer to [mcp/README.md](mcp/README.md).

### slides-agent-demo

This directory holds the code for the AI agent created during the podcast recording. It was bootstrapped using the Agent Starter Pack and developed with the help of [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google). This serves as a practical example of rapid agent development and deployment on Google Cloud.

Please see the [slides-agent-demo/README.md](slides-agent-demo/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and deploy this agent.

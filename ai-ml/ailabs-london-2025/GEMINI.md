# Project guidelines

If unitialized, initialize the project with `uv init && uv venv`
Use `python` + `FastAPI` by default, unless the user says otherwise
To run the project, instruct the user to type on the command line `uv run uvicorn main:app`. Do not run the process in background.
For the frontend, only use plain HTML/CSS and JS

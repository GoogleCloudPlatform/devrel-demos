# ðŸŽ» Music Education Multi-Agent with ADK and A2A ðŸŽ¼

This sample demonstrates how [Agent2Agent](https://a2a-protocol.org/) protocol helps AI agents collaborate with each other.

The [Agent2Agent (A2A)](https://a2a-protocol.org/) Protocol is an open standard developed by Google and donated to the Linux Foundation designed to enable seamless communication and collaboration between AI agents.

## Introduction

There are 2 agents in this sample:

- Music Education Agent that helps students learn about classical compositions.
- Music History Agent that helps students learn about historical topics.

Both agents are built with [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/), but the Music History agent is available as an A2A agent,
that any other agent can call. And that's what Music Education Agent does using ADK's `RemoteA2aAgent` class.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites**:

- Python 3.12
- A Google Cloud project.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)

**Install Dependencies**:

```bash
uv sync
```

**Configure the environment**:

These agents use [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) to access Gemini models in Google Cloud.

1. Rename `.env-sample` file to `.env`.
2. Set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable to the Id of your Google Cloud Project.
3. Set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` to the region to use with Vertex AI.
4. Enable Vertex AI APIs:

  ```bash
  source .env
  gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com --project ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}
  ```

**Run the Historical Context Agent (`RemoteA2AAgent`)**

Rather than running this in the ADK Web UI or with an interactive runner, we'll run this helper agent as a backend *API server* that our root Music Education Agent can call.

```bash
source .env
uv run uvicorn history_agent.agent:a2a_app --host localhost --port 8001
```

**Verify that the Agent Card is available over localhost**:

Navigate to: http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent-card.json

*Expected output*:

```json
{"capabilities":{},"defaultInputModes":["text/plain"],"defaultOutputModes":["text/plain"],"description":"Agent that performs historical research using Wikipedia and Google Search","name":"historical_context_agent","preferredTransport":"JSONRPC","protocolVersion":"0.3.0","skills":[{"description":"Agent that performs historical research using Wikipedia and Google Search \nI am a history education agent that helps students learn about historical topics.\n\nI will be given a topic as a text query. my task is to search relevant knowledge bases for key, authoritative information about that topic.\n\nFor instance, if the topic is a person, look up biographical details about that person's life.

```

**[Optional] Run the A2A Inspector**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-inspector.git
cd a2a-inspector
uv sync
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

*Expected output*:

```bash
Starting backend server...
A2A Inspector is running!
Frontend PID: 36525
Backend PID: 36549
Press Ctrl+C to stop both services
[BACKEND] INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/Users/username/a2a-inspector/backend']
[BACKEND] INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:5001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5001 in a browser. Then, enter the following as the Agent Card URL: `http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent-card.json`

You should be able to see the agent card.

**Run the Music Education Agent**:

In another terminal tab, from the `music-education-a2a` root directory:

```bash
source .env
export REMOTE_AGENT_CARD="http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent-card.json"
uv run adk web
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/dev-ui/?app=music_ed_agent in a browser.

**Test prompts:**
- Dvorak 9th Symphony 2nd movement
- Rachmaninov 2nd piano concerto 1st movement
- Brahms 3rd Symphony 3rd movement
- Bach - Goldberg Variations
- Mozart Sinfonia Concertante in E flat
- Mahler Symphony no. 2 finale
- Wagner Tristan und Isolde
- Sibelius Symphony no. 2
- Symphony No. 5 in C Minor, Op. 67 by Ludwig van Beethoven
- "Eine kleine Nachtmusik" (Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major), K. 525 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart:
- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, BWV 565 by Johann Sebastian Bach:
-"Clair de lune" from Suite bergamasque by Claude Debussy
- "Ride of the Valkyries" from Die WalkÃ¼re by Richard Wagner

... Or any classical music piece you want to learn more about!

## Run in Google Cloud

**Prerequisites**:

- A Google Cloud project.
- gcloud CLI installed on your machine.

**Build and deploy history agent to Cloud Run** --

```bash
source .env
gcloud run deploy history-agent \
  --source history_agent \
  --region "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION}" \
  --project "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}" \
  --set-env-vars GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=${GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION},GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT},GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true \
  --memory 4Gi \
  --cpu 1 \
  --timeout 60s \
  --min 1
```

**Build and deploy music ed agent to Cloud Run** --

```bash
source .env
project_number=$(gcloud projects describe "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}" --format="value(projectNumber)" -q)
history_agent_card_url="https://history-agent-${project_number}.${GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION}.run.app/.well-known/agent-card.json"
gcloud run deploy music-ed-agent \
  --source music_ed_agent \
  --region "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION}" \
  --project "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}" \
  --set-env-vars REMOTE_AGENT_CARD=${history_agent_card_url},GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=${GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION},GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT},GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 4Gi \
  --cpu 1 \
  --timeout 60s \
  --min 1
```

Open Music Education Agent URL provided by the Cloud Run deployment command for music-ed-agent.
You should be able to see ADK Web UI,
and interact with the Music Education Agent that will call History Agent deployed to another Cloud Run service.

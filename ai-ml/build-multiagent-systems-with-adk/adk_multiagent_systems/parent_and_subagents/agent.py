Defines the agents for the first part of the lab (parent-subagent example).

This module contains the initial definitions for:
- 'attractions_planner': A sub-agent to list attractions for a country.
- 'travel_brainstormer': A sub-agent to help a user decide on a country.
- 'root_agent' ('steering'): The parent agent that directs the conversation
                            to the correct sub-agent.
